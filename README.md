# Unoffical Plex HTPC flatpak

This repo contains the flatpak metadata and auxiliary files for the unofficial Plex HTPC flatpak. 

The difference between this flatpak and the official one is that this one doesn't use the pre-built libraries (libmpv2, ffmpeg, etc) and ffmpeg is built with, almost, all the options enabled. 

**WARNING**
Since ffmpeg is also built with --enable-gpl, redistribution of the resulting flatpak may be illegal!
